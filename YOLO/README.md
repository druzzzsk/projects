### License plate recognition 
This project involved the implementation and testing of an automatic license plate recognition system based on the modern object detection algorithm YOLO (You Only Look Once). The goal was to detect and localize vehicle license plates in real-time or from static images.

Three variations of the YOLO v11 model were evaluated and compared:

- YOLO-Nano — the smallest and most lightweight model, optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones.
- YOLO-Small — offers higher accuracy with moderate GPU usage.
- YOLO-Medium — a deeper and more precise architecture suitable for high-accuracy tasks.
  
The results demonstrated a trade-off between model size, inference speed, and detection accuracy, allowing selection of an appropriate variant based on application requirements.
